# IntermediatePythonNotes_Patrick-Loeber-Course

This repository contains all the code I wrote and practiced while following [Patrick Loeber's *Intermediate Python Programming Course*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGOBQPFzWKo).

I haven’t included any detailed explanations, as this notebook is intended for **revision purposes**, not for teaching.

The repository features multiple code examples for most of the topics covered. I’ve included only the topics I found important, omitting those that cover basic-level Python.

I've also added comments and points to remember for lines I thought could be particularly useful.
